## About Me
Hello my name is James and I am a jr CSC student. I like sports (soccer), language learning, and computers. On my free time I like hanging out with friends, exploring different cultures, practicing languages and watching soccer. One day I would like to travel to a couple of countries and maybe even live there for a while.


## My CSC340 Goals
I have a little bit of experience (self projects) with web development. However I would like to get a good understanding of Java in the development space as it is something I have never experienced. I really like to using html and css especially the artistic side of creating web pages. I am interested to learn how they connect to the backend portion and how the spring boot framwork works. By the end of this course I would like to have a good grasp on both aspects the front end and back end of a webpage using the spring boot framwork with java.
